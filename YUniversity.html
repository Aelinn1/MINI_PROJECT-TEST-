                    <h4>History of Anthropology</h4>
                    <p align="left" style="font-size: 14px;">
                        The Department of Anthropology in Yangon University was established in 1950, in Judson Hall. Its
                        location on the campus
                        has moved over the years: first, to the Social Science building, then in 1964 to Taungoo Hall. Since
                        1983 the
                        Anthropology Department has been located in Yamanya Hall. The Department started small, with few staff
                        and students but
                        then expanded to include Sociology and even International Relations for a few years until Anthropology
                        was reduced to a
                        minor subject status under the new education system in 1964. At that point, the Department shrank in
                        numbers of staff
                        and students, until 1982 when Anthropology was restored to major subject status again. <br>
                        In the early years of the Department, several overseas academics supported the teaching of Anthropology,
                        Sociology and
                        International Relations in Yangon, while several Myanmar academics furthered their studies in the USA
                        and the UK.
                        Nowadays the Department is staffed by Myanmar academics. <br>
                        <b>Anthropology can be taken by Arts students as well as Science students.</b>Science students taking
                        Anthropology as a minor
                        subject can earn a B.A Degree. Post-graduate students have to carry out field research and collect
                        survey data for their
                        Masters thesis. <br>
                        Following the example of the University of Yangon, in the late 1950s other intermediate colleges
                        teaching Anthropology
                        were opened in Myanmar: in Mawlamyine, Pathein and Kyaukphyu.
                        Detailed History: The Department of Anthropology in Yangon University was established in 1950 under the
                        Rector at that
                        time, Dr. Htin Aung, in Judson Hall. Dr Htin Aung was also an honorary professor of the Anthropology
                        Department,
                        lecturing with visiting professor Dr. K. G. Orr from Chicago University. <br>
                        To begin with the Anthropology Department had seven first year students and three post graduate
                        students. Daw Khin Khin
                        Oo and Daw Khin Hmway were appointed tutors before Dr. K. G. Orr left to go back to Chicago. Then the
                        two tutors were
                        sent on state scholarships to Chicago and Alabama Universities in the USA and Mr. Musgrave lectured
                        during their
                        absence. <br>
                        When Daw Khin Khin Oo and Daw Khin Hmway returned from the USA in the a/y 1952-1953, Daw Khin Khin Oo
                        was appointed Head
                        of the Anthropology Department and the Department started teaching a range of classes from intermediate
                        level, with a
                        Masters degree introduced in 1957.
